## pnetCDF: Parallel netcdf

https://github.com/dhoule/Parallel-DBSCAN

Compilation of pnetCDF did not worked from the docker file, but worked from the terminal in Jupyter
after the container was installed...

From the terminal I ran the following command
>bash
>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/conda/lib
>cd /notebooks/pnetcdf-1.12.1
>mkdir build
>cd build
>../configure CC=mpicc --prefix=/opt/conda --enable-shared
>make -j 
>make install

In the dockerfile I have added the files created after the installation.
They are contained in packages/pnetcdf and need to be added to /opt/conda/

# parallel-DBSCAN
>bash
>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/conda/lib
>cd /notebooks/pDBSCAN/bin
>make

We modify the Makefile so that we point to the right directories:
------------------------
PNET_DIR = /opt/conda
MPI_DIR = /opt/conda
BOOST_DIR = /opt/conda
------------------------

Testing parallel dbscan using the dataset:
>mpirun -n 4 dbscan -i datasets/clus50k.bin -b -m 5 -e 25 -o out_clusters.nc
